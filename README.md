homebrew-kde
============

KDE tap for homebrew


Installation
------------

`brew tap Anonymooseable/kde` (or the appropriate github username if you're tapping a fork...).
It will spit out a few warnings like  `Warning: Could not tap anonymooseable/kde/ffmpeg over mxcl/master/ffmpeg`. These can be safely ignored.
Careful with installing the packages listed: some of the formulae included in homebrew *may* not be compatible with the KDE software.
Also sorry about my long username that makes typing the install commands a little bit of a pain :D
